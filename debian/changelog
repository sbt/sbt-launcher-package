sbt (0.13.13) stable; urgency=low

  * The `new` command, which helps creating new build definitions.
    This is extensible via `templateResolverInfos` setting.
    sbt 0.13.13 will ship with Giter8 template resolver out of the box.
    #2705 by @eed3si9n
  * Auto plugins can add synthetic subprojects. #2717 by @eed3si9n
  * The no-longer-documented sbt 0.12 DSL `<<=`, `<+=`, and `<++=`
    operators and tuple enrichment are now marked deprecated.
    (These are removed in 1.0.x branch.) @eed3si9n and @dwijnand
  * The `.value` method is deprecated for input tasks since `.evaluated`
    is normally what's needed.
    (Also removed in 1.0.x branch) #2709 by @eed3si9n
  * sbt 0.13.13 will display deprecation warning for build.sbt.
    #2784 by @eed3si9n
  * Renames the early command `--<command>` that was added in 0.13.1 to
    `early(<command>)`. `--error` will work, but we encourage you to
    migrate to single hyphen version: `-error`, `-warn`, `-info`, and
    `-debug`. #2742 by @eed3si9n
