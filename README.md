sbt: the launcher
==================

An alternative script for running [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt).
It works with sbt 0.7.x projects as well as 0.10+. If you're in an sbt
project directory, the runner will figure out the versions of sbt and
scala required by the project and download them if necessary.

Sample usage: create a new project using a snapshot version of sbt as
well as a snapshot version of scala, then run the sbt "about" command.

    % sbt -v -sbt-snapshot -sbt-create about
    Detected sbt version 0.11.3-SNAPSHOT
    sbt snapshot is 0.11.3-20111207-052114

      -sbt-rc                   use an RC version of sbt

    In the case of duplicated or conflicting options, the order above
    shows precedence: JAVA_OPTS lowest, command line options highest.
